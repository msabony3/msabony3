About Me

---

I am an analytically minded data professional with an MBA in Business Analytics from Binghamton University. My work thus far sits at the intersection of business analysis and technical problem solving. I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful narratives that drive better decisions and measurable outcomes.

My background combines experience in data analysis, reporting, and process optimization. At Anchortex Corporation, I led initiatives that improved marketing efficiency and operational visibility through data cleaning, automation, and reporting. Using Excel, Generative AI, and Power Query, I streamlined lead tracking, enhanced reporting accuracy, and uncovered new business opportunities. At the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, I collaborated with finance and audit teams to analyze contracts and recover over $75,000 in missed earnings, deepening my understanding of data integrity and its impact on organizational performance.

I have a strong command of Python, SQL, and R for data preparation, analysis, and visualization, as well as Power BI, Looker, and Excel for interactive reporting. My technical work spans exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and data-driven storytelling. I am particularly interested in how predictive analytics and visualization can inform strategic business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

Outside of formal roles, I’ve developed and documented projects applying machine learning, statistical testing, and data visualization to real-world datasets. These include analyses of housing markets, payroll structures, and behavioral datasets — each project emphasizing reproducibility, clarity, and communication of insight.

I’m passionate about data because it reveals the “why” behind outcomes — the patterns that explain, predict, and shape how organizations move forward. My goal is to continue bridging analytical precision with strategic thinking to create solutions that are not only technically sound but also practically valuable.

I’m constantly looking to learn new things, challenge myself, and close the gaps in what I don’t yet know. When I encounter something unfamiliar, I’m driven to understand it fully and efficiently — not just to solve the problem, but to master it.

In my free time I love to watch movies, old and new, from all around the world and in all different languages, exercise, learn about history, and in general do activities that give me a feelnig of progress and growth.
